      Hello, my name is Yorian Ixcol. I am a new programmer, and this year I discovered the complexities that come with being a coder. I am a patient coder and a very outgoing one. When I have questions, I try my best to ask. I try to recognize the fact that I'm no expert, but also don't let that completely define me. I like to learn. This is why I consider myself a very beginner-level developer. This only pushes me to continue persuing technological knowledge and tryig to master coding.

        This year I learned the complexities of coding, and how we take developers' skills for granted. I learned the basics of computers, like binary code, and the basics of C++, but I was also introduced to things such as HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Designing using these languages was one of my favorite things to do. Though, it sometimes requierd time that was hard for me to find, I always found it an enjoyable thing. Beyond academics, this class also taught me a very valuable life lesson. Even if things don't turn out as I had planned them, it doesn't mean its all lost. The loss of Mr. Moreno was really challenging but we got through the year. I really appreciate all the people that made our academic journey a little easier in regards of Mr. Morenos passing. Mr. Alvarado clutched and taught. This class was really cool. This year was odd, but it taught me many great things. Muchas gracias.

    <p class="project-description">
       Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. One player is X and the other is O, and they take turns marking empty squares. The first to get three in a row—across, down, or diagonally wins, or it ends in a tie if the board fills up with no evident row pattern.

    </a>
    <p class="project-description">
      A memory card game is played with all the cards facing down. Players take turns flipping over two cards, trying to find a matching pair. If they match, the player keeps the pair and goes again. If this isn't the case, cards are flipped back and it’s the next player’s turn. This goes on until there are no cards left to be flipped.
