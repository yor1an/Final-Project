      <p>
        My name is Yorian. Yorian Ixcol Velasquez is my full name. I am from a place called San Pablo, in Guatemala. I used to be a concerningly shy and antisocial person, and now I am a person who really likes spending time with people. I knew that it was better to be with people when I realized that no day that I usually denominate as "one of the best days of my life" ever happened when I was alone. It was always with people, like the day at the lake with my friend Pollo, or the amazing music we played with my church's band in LA. I love my friends and family. Lastly, it is a dream of mine to travel the world and meet people and places with different cultures. It really does sound amazing.

    <p class="project-description">
       Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. One player is X and the other is O, and they take turns marking empty squares. The first to get three in a row—across, down, or diagonally wins, or it ends in a tie if the board fills up with no evident row pattern.

    </a>
    <p class="project-description">
      A memory card game is played with all the cards facing down. Players take turns flipping over two cards, trying to find a matching pair. If they match, the player keeps the pair and goes again. If this isn't the case, cards are flipped back and it’s the next player’s turn. This goes on until there are no cards left to be flipped.
